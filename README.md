```emplate for Jason's summer internship projects


Description: This Summer I had an opportunity to do a voluntary internship with my Blunt Technologies LLC.  One of the projects we worked on was evaluating solution providers for managed security Service provider (MSSP).  We evaluted 3 vendors and this is where I talk about what I built, tested and learned from this project.
